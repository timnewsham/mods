To build the synthesizer:
------------------------
   - the synthesizer is designed to be built under linux using gnu make
   - edit the makefile and select a GUI and an architecture by
     uncommenting the appropriate include lines.  By default the
     synthesizer is made with linux support and with GTK and curses
     GUIs.
   - make depend
   - make

   NOTE: if you decide to change GUIs or architectures, you will have to 
   make clean, then make depend and the make again.


To use:
-------
   - run the synth and build a configuration

     or
   
     pick an existing config file (see the configs directory) and
     run "synth <configfile>".  Some config files worth trying are:
         simple           - a very simple synthesizer
         fullsynth        - a more realistic synthesizer
         fullsynth-scope  - fullsynth with output being plot on an oscope
         fullsynth-midi   - fullsynth with input from midi

     or

     create a configuration file in a text editor and use it.
     There are more configuration files in the extra directory.


   - play notes on the keyboard while one of the synthesizer windows
     has focus. 
         zxcvb = c, d, e, f, ...
         qwert = c, d, e, f, ...
         +/- = change octave up or down

   - adjust the knobs with the mouse

   - select drag modules or knobs around by using the right mouse button.
     Use shift to select multiple modules at once.


See LIST for a description of the modules and how they are used.



GENERAL NOTES:
--------------

CURSES NOTES:
-------------
    - this user interface cannot be used to build configurations.
      You may build a configuration by editing a spec file by
      hand, or load configurations built with another gui.
    - the gui is still lacking many features.

GTK NOTES:
----------
    - the gtk gui is very infantile.
    - There is a bug that causes the wires in the design pad to disapear
      at times.  If you see this happening, update your gtk library.  It
      was fixed sometime before or at gtk 1.2.5.
      Urgh.. ok, it still happens, but less frequently now.

LINUX NOTES:
------------

    - if you are using the commercial OSS sound drivers, you have a 
      noticeable delay between when a key is pressed and when audio is 
      sent through the speaker.
      Actually, I noticed this with another card not using the OSS commercial
      drivers.  On my laptop, however, I can control the delay (amount of
      buffering) with an ioctl.  I'm not sure why I can't for other cards.
    - MIDI input is supported, but currently only note-on and note-off
      messages are processed.  The /dev/midi device is used, and the
      synthesizer will respond to commands on any MIDI channel.  This
      will be configurable in the future.
