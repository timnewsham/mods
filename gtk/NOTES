TODO:
  - add "wires" that redraw when they are in an exposed area,
    reshape when the endpoints they are attached to gets moved,
    get deleted when an endpoint gets deleted

  - allow selection of modules, knobs and wires, keeping
    corresponding knobs and widgets in the same state (ie.
    knob representation and knob module)

  - knob and modbox widgets should compute heights based on
    font height.  font should be selected in rc file
  - widgets should use gtk styles and rc files
